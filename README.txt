HOW TO USE
data <- readRDS("mockdata/wholeMatrix.rds")
Preferably save cg positions in an array
Specific studies can be chosen too

traits <- traitTable(data)

data1 <- processData(data)

By default the next function will use 15th study from matrix
        generated by processData
data2 <- makeConnections(data1, name = "studyName",
        type = "", traitMatrix = traits)

If there is a need for colors and a legend then please provide
        a dataframe with studynames and trait group like this:
colors <- rainbow(21)
colors <- colors[c(-1)] ##Because first must not be red because
        it's study color by default
data2 <- groupColors(data2, aMatrixWithGroup, anArrayOfColors

Possibility to check connections in terminal window
similar <- getSimilarTraits(data2)

network <- getVisNetwork(data2)


The other graph which allows to check position overlaps
positions <- names(which(data1[,19] == TRUE))
df <- dfForHistogram(data, positions)
hist <- stackedHistogram(df, 0)
